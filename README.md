# Web Scraping For Mars Information

Andrew Anastasiades | @andrew-ana

## Description
This project is a demonstration of web driving, mongoDB, flask and HTML/CSS. I have a lot of experience with webdriving using selenium, so the transition to splinter (an abstraction layer above selenium) was a breeze. The mongo back end was easy enough to set up but the real difficulty comes from flask overwriting expected data while I was serving my webpages. Debugging is honestly such a challenge when you are doing end to end design. Anyway, I hope you enjoy my hideously bootstrapped website. The data on the page is actually refreshed when you click the button so I suppose I have achieved the desired functionality.
